## v4.0.0
Themes have been broken out into their own packages. This package was originally part of @pxblue/themes. If you are switching to this package, you'll need to update some import statements (refer to the usage instructions in the README).

- Updates default text colors to match PX Blue palette
- Disables automatic UPPERCASE transform on buttons
