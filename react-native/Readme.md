# React Native
The React Native theme provides a color palette but not a comprehensive automatic styling system. You will need to manually apply the appropriate colors to various elements in your application.

```
import * as Colors from '@pxblue/themes/react-native'
...
<Text style={{color: Colors.blue['500']}}>Hello World!</Text>
```
