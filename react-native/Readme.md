# React Native Theme
```
import { ThemeProvider } from '@pxblue/react-native-components';
import * as PXBThemes from '@pxblue/themes/react-native';
...
// Default Theme
<ThemeProvider theme={PXBThemes.blue}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

> **NOTE:** Using the PX Blue React Native theme requires that you add the Open Sans font to your application. You can learn how to do this by reading the instructions for [Vanilla React Native](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-custom-fonts-ccc9aacf9e5e) or [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-custom-fonts/).
